echo "Your event processor implementation code goes here";

# The purpose of the event processor is to query the database for
# unprocessed events and process each event according to its name/type.
#
# Events are queued by the mock application located in ./application.php.
# The mock events are queued via the event client located in ./client.php.
#
# To run the event processor:
#   $ php server.php
